# executive_metrics_rollup — LangGraph worked example

End-to-end demonstration of the SecOps-NG LangGraph reference compiler
on the executive_metrics_rollup CACAO playbook. It is aimed at an
integrator who already runs LangGraph and wants to adopt a portable
SecOps-NG playbook without re-platforming: the example shows exactly
which artifacts the compiler produces, how they fit together, and
where the integrator owns the seams.

## Files in this directory

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `playbook.cacao.json` | Portable CACAO v2 playbook — the input to the compiler. |
| `graph_spec.json` | Target-neutral GraphSpec (nodes, edges, conditional edges) emitted by `compilers.langgraph.emit`. |
| `state_bindings.py` | Generated `TypedDict` state + `@tool`-decorated action wrappers + agentic-extension hook, emitted by `compilers.langgraph.state`. |
| `assemble.py` | Hand-written reference assembly that wires the GraphSpec + bindings into a `langgraph.graph.StateGraph`. |
| `regenerate.sh` | Re-runs both emitters from the playbook and overwrites the two generated artifacts. |

## How to regenerate

After any change to the playbook or to `compilers/langgraph/*`, refresh
the committed artifacts from the repo root:

```bash
./content-model/examples/executive_metrics_rollup/langgraph/regenerate.sh
```

The script re-emits `graph_spec.json` and `state_bindings.py` from
`playbook.cacao.json` using `compilers.langgraph.emit` and
`compilers.langgraph.state`. The compiler golden suite in
`tests/compilers/langgraph/` pins the same emitters against the shared
fixture, so any drift surfaces in CI rather than in an operator's
LangGraph deployment.

## What this example deliberately doesn't do

- It does not execute the graph. The `@tool` bodies raise
  `NotImplementedError`; integrators wire them to their own runtime,
  KPI/KRI catalog source, and board-pack pipeline.
- It does not ship operator credentials, catalog content, or
  scoring policy. Those stay with the operator.
- It does not pick an LLM provider for the agentic-extension hook.
  `AGENTIC_HOOK` is a documented placeholder; the operator chooses a
  provider that matches their sovereignty posture at integration time.

## Sovereignty note

LangGraph is open source (MIT) and runs as a Python process: hosting
it on EU sovereign infrastructure (Nebul, OVHcloud, Scaleway, Hetzner)
is a deployment choice, not a vendor decision. The agentic-extension
hook is provider-neutral by design — the compiler never embeds an LLM
SDK, so the operator can wire it to self-hosted open-weights inference
or to an EU-hosted managed endpoint without regenerating the artifact.
